Project Objectives
=========

The mission of the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) Public Transit Division (PTD) is to support mobility options for Oregonians through advocacy, collaborative partnerships, and grant programs. The availability of  transportation choices helps to create social equity, access to jobs and critical services, connectivity, and a robust state economy [(1)](http://www.oregon.gov/ODOT/PT/Pages/about.aspx). To accomplish this mission, the PTD provides grants, policy leadership and technical assistance to communities and local transportation providers to provide transportation to people. 

Based on the PTD's long experience in dealing with public transit issues, the majority of investments made in transit service by state, local, and federal government agencies are:

  1. Based on local service providers' individual priorities, and
  2. Made with limited ability to consider the impact that these investments may have on the larger transit network.

Prior to the TNA software tool, the ODOT's PTD does not have an integrated tool that will help their planners to better understand and assess gaps in spatial and temporal transit schedule connectivity, and organize this information to help analyze the performance of the larger state transit network and how this correlates to populations within the state.

The objectives of this project are: 

 * Take advantage of the available GTFS data to develop a better understanding and more efficient utilization of existing state-wide and region-wide transit networks
 * Develop a computer-based tool (or tools) that can receive transit network data, and structure it to analyze and report on the Oregon transit network, as described by GTFS data
 * The proposed Transit Network Analysis (TNA) computer-based tool(s) shall be web-based, stand-alone solution(s)
